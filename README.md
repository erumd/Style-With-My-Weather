Style-With-My-Weather-App
### Description:
This website is primarily for tourist however, anyone can use it. It will help them to get the temperature for the city travelled, book hotel, know how to dress, know nearby clothing stores, nearby restaurants, night life, attractions, and hotels to achieve a fun day roaming around their location. For each of these pages the google map will load pictures of the destination, reviews, and price range. This website is beneficial because it includes everything they need to know to get through the city all on one website. The recent city searched is saved to local storage and automatically loads all of the map pages except hotels. Hotel pages gives you the option to search for hotels in other cities. 

## APIs
[Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/)

[Google Maps](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform)


## Web-View:
For you to maneuver through this application with any problems the user will type in the city they wish to search on the weather tab. The user will be presented with a layout of the weather forecast up to the next 6 hours as well as the predicted forecast for the next 5 days, detailing the temperature in both fahrenheit and celsius, humidity, and precipitation. When the user tabs over to one of the other tabs, night life, clothing stores, attractions, hotels or restaurants they will be able to have their previous search on these pages pull up in the new tabs. With the hotel tab the user would need to search for their city once again for the API to generate the pop ups of nearby hotels that they may check into.

These are the screenshots of what our website looks like:
